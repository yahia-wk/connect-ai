# This script allows you to test your solution.
# Your coursework implementation must always be player 1.
# You should consider changing player 2 to use a minimax approach for evaluation.
# It is recommended that you also consider other game board sizes, and vary the number of pieces 
# that are required in a line to win. There are examples of the method calls to create such games
# commented out below.

# Player 2 currently picks random moves and so, while player 2 is not very good, it does allow you to
# start testing your solution. Once you have something sensible, you should change player 2 to be more 
# intelligent. Note that you can specify a seed for the random player (currently the seed is '42'),
# which allows for testing in a consistent environment.
# Note that the following two lines seed the random player differently each run
seed = datetime.now().timestamp()
#p2 = randomPlayer.RandomPlayer("O", seed)

# Instead of randomly seeding, you can comment out the following line to seed the random player and
# test with a consistent opponent
# p2 = randomPlayer.RandomPlayer("O", 42)

# You can pass 'True' to the playGame() method to test your alpha-beta pruning approach, i.e., to make
